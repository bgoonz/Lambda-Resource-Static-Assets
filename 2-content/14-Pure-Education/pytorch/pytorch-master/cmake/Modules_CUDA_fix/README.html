<p>This <code>./upstream</code> subfolder contains fixes for <code>FindCUDA</code> that are introduced in later versions of cmake but cause generator expression errors in earlier CMake versions. Specifically:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>a problem where a generator expression for include directories was passed to NVCC, where the generator expression itself was prefixed by <code>-I</code>. As the NNPACK include directory generator expression expands to multiple directories, the second and later ones were not prefixed by <code>-I</code>, causing NVCC to return an error. First fixed in CMake 3.7 (see <a href="https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/commit/7ded655f">Kitware/CMake@7ded655f</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Windows VS2017 fixes that allows one to define the ccbin path differently between earlier versions of Visual Studio and VS2017. First introduced after 3.10.1 master version (see <a href="https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/commit/bc88329e">Kitware/CMake@bc88329e</a>).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The downside of using these fixes is that <code>./upstream/CMakeInitializeConfigs.cmake</code>, defining some new CMake variables (added in <a href="https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/commit/48f7e2d3">Kitware/CMake@48f7e2d3</a>), must be included before <code>./upstream/FindCUDA.cmake</code> to support older CMake versions. A wrapper <code>./FindCUDA.cmake</code> is created to do this automatically, and to allow submodules to use these fixes because we can’t patch their <code>CMakeList.txt</code>.</p>
<p>If you need to update files under <code>./upstream</code> folder, we recommend you issue PRs against <a href="https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/tree/master/Modules/FindCUDA.cmake">the CMake mainline branch</a>, and then backport it here for earlier CMake compatibility.</p>
