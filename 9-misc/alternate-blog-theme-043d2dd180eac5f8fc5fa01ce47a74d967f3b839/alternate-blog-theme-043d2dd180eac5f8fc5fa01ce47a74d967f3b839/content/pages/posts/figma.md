title: Family_Promise UX Work
subtitle: >-
    Family Promise helps local communities coordinate their compassion to address
    the root causes of family homelessness. They tap existing local resources to
    empower families towards economic stability. Families come to them in crisis;
    they help them rebuild their lives with new skills and ongoing support. They
    address the issue holistically, providing prevention services before families
    reach crisis, shelter and case management when they become homeless, and
    stabilization programs once they have secured housing to ensure they remain
    independent.

    health will recharge and how I benefit from it.
