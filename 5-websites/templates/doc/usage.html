<h1 id="usage">Usage</h1>
<p>The most basic usage of HTML5 Boilerplate is to create a static site or simple app. Once you’ve downloaded or cloned the project, that process looks something like this:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Set up the basic structure of the site.</li>
<li>Add some content, style, and functionality.</li>
<li>Run your site locally to see how it looks.</li>
<li>Deploy your site.</li>
</ol>
<p>Cool, right? <em>It is</em>. That said, the smart defaults, baseline elements, default attribute values and various other utilities that HTML5 Boilerplate offers can serve as the foundation for whatever you’re interested in building.</p>
<p>Even the basic use-case of a simple static site can be enhanced by manipulating the code through an automated build process. Moving up in complexity HTML5 Boilerplate can be integrated with whatever front-end framework, CMS or e-commerce platform you’re working with. Mix-and-match to your heart’s content. Use what you need (toss it in a blender if you need to) and discard the rest. HTML5 Boilerplate is a starting point, not a destination.</p>
