<p>Docusaurus v2 is <strong>still alpha</strong> (since mid-2019) but already quite stable.</p>
<p>We highly encourage you to <strong>use Docusaurus v2 over Docusaurus v1</strong>.</p>
<p>Most users are already using v2 (<a href="https://www.npmtrends.com/docusaurus-vs-@docusaurus/core">trends</a>), including <a href="https://reactnative.dev">React Native</a>, <a href="https://redux.js.org/">Redux</a> and <a href="/showcase">many others</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Use Docusaurus v2 if:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>:white_check_mark: You want a modern Jamstack documentation site</li>
<li>:white_check_mark: You want a single-page application (SPA) with client-side routing</li>
<li>:white_check_mark: You want the full power of React and MDX</li>
<li>:white_check_mark: You do not need support for IE11</li>
</ul>
<div class="tip">
<p>Use <strong><a href="https://new.docusaurus.io">new.docusaurus.io</a></strong> to test Docusaurus immediately in CodeSandbox.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Use <a href="https://v1.docusaurus.io/">Docusaurus v1</a> if:</strong></p>

<p>Docusaurus 1 used to be a pure documentation site generator. In Docusaurus 2, we rebuilt it from the ground up, allowing for more customizability but preserved the best parts of Docusaurus 1 - easy to get started, versioned docs, and i18n (<em>coming soon</em>).</p>
<p>Beyond that, Docusaurus 2 is a <strong>performant static site generator</strong> and can be used to create common content-driven websites (e.g. Documentation, Blogs, Product Landing and Marketing Pages, etc) extremely quickly.</p>
<p>While our main focus will still be helping you get your documentations right and well, it is possible to build any kind of website using Docusaurus 2 as it is just a React application. <strong>Docusaurus can now be used to build any website, not just documentation websites.</strong></p>

<h2 id="comparison-with-other-tools">Comparison with other tools</h2>
<p>Across all static site generators, Docusaurus has a unique focus on doc sites and has out-of-the-box structure you need.</p>
<p>We’ve also studied other main static site generators and would like to share our insights on the comparison, hopefully to help you navigate through the prismatic choices out there.</p>
<h3 id="gatsby">Gatsby</h3>
<p>Gatsby is packed with a lot of features, has a rich ecosystem of plugins and is capable of doing everything that Docusaurus does. Naturally, that comes at a cost of a higher learning curve. Gatsby does many things well and is suitable for building many types of websites. On the other hand, Docusaurus tries to do one thing super well - be the best tool for writing and publishing content.</p>
<p>GraphQL is also pretty core to Gatsby, although you don’t necessarily need GraphQL to build a Gatsby site. In most cases when building static websites, you won’t need the flexibility that GraphQL provides.</p>
<p>Many aspects of Docusaurus 2 were inspired by the best things about Gatsby and it’s a great alternative.</p>
<h3 id="gitbook">GitBook</h3>
<p>GitBook has very clean design and has been used by many open source projects. With its focus shifting towards a commercial product rather than an open-source tool, many of its requirements no longer fit the needs as an open source project’s documentation site. As a result, many have turned to other products. You may read about Redux’s switch to Docusaurus <a href="https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/issues/3161">here</a>.</p>
<p>Currently, GitBook is only free for open-source and non-profit teams. Docusaurus is free for everyone.</p>
<h3 id="jekyll">Jekyll</h3>
<p>Jekyll is one of the most mature static site generators around and has been a great tool to use — in fact, before Docusaurus, most of Facebook’s Open Source websites are/were built on Jekyll! It is extremely simple to get started. We want to bring a similar developer experience as building a static site with Jekyll.</p>
<p>In comparison with statically generated HTML and interactivity added using <code>&lt;script /&gt;</code> tags, Docusaurus sites are React apps. Using modern JavaScript ecosystem tooling, we hope to set new standards on doc sites performance, asset build pipeline and optimizations, and ease to setup.</p>
<h3 id="vuepress">VuePress</h3>
<p>VuePress has many similarities with Docusaurus - both focus heavily on content-centric website and provides tailored documentation features out of the box. However, VuePress is powered by Vue, while Docusaurus is powered by React. If you want a Vue-based solution, VuePress would be a decent choice.</p>

<p>For new feature requests, you can create a post on our <a href="/feedback">Canny board</a>, which is a handy tool for roadmapping and allows for sorting by upvotes, which gives the core team a better indicator of what features are in high demand, as compared to GitHub issues which are harder to triage. Refrain from making a Pull Request for new features (especially large ones) as someone might already be working on it or will be part of our roadmap. Talk to us first!</p>
