    <p>
      A companion extension to
      <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-js-debug">js-debug</a> to enable remote Chrome
      debugging. You probably don’t want to install this extension by itself, but for your interest,
      this is what it does.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scenario is if you are developing in a remote environment—like WSL, a container, ssh, or
      <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/visual-studio-codespaces/"
        >VS Codespaces</a
      >—and are port-forwarding a server to develop (and debug) in a browser locally. For remote
      development, VS Code runs two sets of extensions: one on the remote machine, and one on your
      local computer. <code>js-debug</code> is a “workspace” extension that runs on the remote
      machine, but we need to launch and talk to Chrome locally.
    </p>
    <p>
      That’s where this companion extension comes in. This helper extension runs on the local
      machine (in the “UI”) and registers a command that <code>js-debug</code> can call to launch a
      server. <code>js-debug</code> requests a port to be forwarded for debug traffic, and once
      launching a browser the companion will connect to and forward traffic over that socket.
