    <h1 id="references-view">References View</h1>
    <p>
      This extension shows reference search results as separate view, just like
      search results. It complements the peek view presentation that is also
      built into VS Code. The following feature are available:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        List All References via the Command Palette, the Context Menu, or via
        <kbd>Alt+Shift+F12</kbd>
      </li>
      <li>View references in a dedicated tree view that sits in the sidebar</li>
      <li>
        Navigate through search results via <kbd>F4</kbd> and
        <kbd>Shift+F4</kbd>
      </li>
      <li>Remove references from the list via inline commands</li>
    </ul>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note</strong> that this extension is bundled with Visual Studio
      Code version 1.29 and later - it doesn’t need to be installed anymore.
    </p>
    <h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
    <p>
      This extension is just an alternative UI for reference search and
      extensions implementing reference search must still be installed.
    </p>
    <h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>
    <p>
      This extension ships with Visual Studio Code and uses its issue tracker.
